TO DO List (Pending)
------------------
[] Establish Scene Manager (currently using individual C# files to handle each scene transition, should be a better way)
[] Find method to implement Laser attack
[] Implement Options
	[] Will need to add more Shots to the object pools (10 -> 40?)
[] Implement other enemy spawn types

2019/11/14 (Thu)
- Migration to full use of Text Mesh Pro for game UI and Canvas completed


2019/11/11 (Mon)
Fixed mock countdown's arcade pattern mesh renderer on Canvas.
	- Need to confirm how mesh renderers behave in canvas.
	

2019/11/10 (Sun)
- Experiment with creating particle system for use with weapons
	- Combination of 2D sprites and 3D effects
	- Cannot use detatch and destroy method due to reusage of bullets
		- Resolved by creating separate pool for bullet effects
			- Extended asset pool function by including effects object association
				- Will be very useful when adding more attacks and enemy effects
- Minor tweaks to effects animations
- Font "Pixel7" added
	- Not perfect monospace font. Need to find another.
- Text Mesh Pro imported to project
	- Migrating text objects to Text Mesh Pro
	- Worth doing to maximize scalability
	- Need to apply Canvas-based approach
		- Setting Screen Space = Camera resolves all prior problems. Holy shit.
- Switched to Canvas for text and other elements
	- Currently only applied to Bootup scene so far. Need to migrate these in CGP.


2019/11/09 (Sat)
- Improved asset pool code to self-populate
	- Replaces previous approach of adding manual population of objects (now can add more instances without needing to reapply each step)
	- Much more convenient as this needs to be applied to other potential asset pools such as enemies, effects, other bullets, etc.
- Added more asteroids to testing area
- Improved thruster effects implementation
	- Minimized lighting rendering by disabling unused objects in scenes
- Speed Up power up effect added
	- Including ring glow FX around player when used (to be applied for all power up usage)
- Bug fixed with asteroid movement randomizer (movement along Z axis disabled)	
- Scoring implemented
- Mock arcade bootup menu added
	- Learnt how to create patterns using this
		- Might have some way to add mock scanlines as an option

		
2019/11/08 (Fri)
- Bullet impact effect created
	- Created asset pool for each bullet impact (separate as not always called such as when bullet leaves screen)
	- Asset pool population very tedious especially when needing to add features as development goes on. Need a more automated approach if possible.

	
2019/11/07 (Thu)
- Thruster effects added
	- Uses 2D sprites

	
2019/11/06 (Wed)
- Title Screen mockup created


2019/11/05 (Tue)
- Player tilt animation issue (using D-Pad) fixed using math-based approach
	- Animator method considered, but want to minimize clutter to animation hierarchy for later
	- Confirmed also works when using analog stick (e.g. DualShock gamepad)

	
2019/11/04 (Mon)
- Power meter responses added upon powerup pick up
- Power ups added
- Asteroid prefab added
- Asset pool implementation for shot firing successful
- 


2019/11/03 (Sun)
- Revision of shmup tutorial & assets retrieved
	- Also using previous Prot_Sidewinder and PARO projects for code and implementation reference
		- Prot_Sidewinder not playable anymore due to deprecated control scheme from asset store
- Basic controls implemented
	- Tilt issue from Prototype still present when using D-Pad inputs. Needs a solution to it for smooth implementation.
- Score & Layout UI added
- Power Meter UI added


2019/11/02 (Sat)
- Basic foundation groundwork established for game
- Mock-ups for features written on paper
- Basic layout, empty scenes created
